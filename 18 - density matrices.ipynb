    "# 1. Density matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Definition of a density matrix\n",
    "We have seen in Lecture 1 that the mathematical representation of the state of a quantum system is a vector of amplitudes. Such representation assumes that we have complete information about the system, and this is not always the case. If we have only partial information about the system, we cannot use a state vector because the Born rule will give us wrong values for the measurement probabilities. For example, if we have a preparation procedure that goes like this: toss a coin and if you obtain _heads_ prepare $|0\\rangle$ while if you obtain _tails_ prepare $|1\\rangle$, how do we compute the probability to obtain the outcomes of a certain measurement?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Born rule as the starting point to derive a more general representation of quantum states, that holds in all cases (however, we should use state vectors if we are allowed to, as they require less memory and less processing power). The Born rule for state vectors says that the probability to obtain the outcome $|i\\rangle$ (belonging to some basis), _given that_ we followed the procedure to prepare the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the mod-square of the inner product (i.e. of the overlap):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(i|\\psi) = |\\langle i|\\psi\\rangle|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will generalize this rule from the point of view of the state preparation: i.e. we will derive what to do if we have uncertainty about the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$. In the next lecture we will generalize this rule from the point of view of the measurement: i.e. we will derive what to do if we have uncertainty about the outcome $|i\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now suppose that instead of knowing with certainty that we have a quantum system in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$, we only know that the state is $|\\psi_j\\rangle$ with probability $P(\\psi_j)$. Note that we did not say that the set $\\{|\\psi_j\\rangle\\}$ is a basis, in fact it can be any set of states. The global probability of observing the result $i$ is the weighted sum of the individual probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(i) &= \\sum_jP(i|\\psi_j)P(\\psi_j) = \\sum_j|\\langle i|\\psi_j\\rangle|^2P(\\psi_j)\\\\\n",
    "&=\\sum_j\\langle i|\\psi_j\\rangle\\langle \\psi_j|i\\rangle P(\\psi_j)=\\langle i|\\biggl(\\sum_jP(\\psi_j)|\\psi_j\\rangle\\langle \\psi_j|\\biggr)|i\\rangle\\\\\n",
    "&=\\langle i|\\rho|i\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have defined the operator $$\\rho = \\sum_jP(\\psi_j)|\\psi_j\\rangle\\langle \\psi_j|$$ which is our __density matrix__ and it represents the state that we assign to the system, taking into account our uncertainty over the set $\\{|\\psi_i\\rangle\\}$ encoded by the probability distribution $P(\\psi_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a few things to notice:\n",
    "1. $\\rho$ is a matrix, not a vector\n",
    "2. if we are 100% sure that the system is in a certain state $\\psi$, $P(\\psi) = 1$ and therefore $\\rho=|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$ and we obtain the old version of the Born rule: $\\langle i |\\rho|i\\rangle = \\langle i|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|i\\rangle= |\\langle i | \\psi\\rangle|^2$. In this case we say that $\\rho$ is the density matrix of a pure state. If a state is not pure, it is \"mixed\".\n",
    "3. A pure state can be written either as a vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ or as a density matrix $|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$, but a mixed state can only be written as a density matrix.\n",
    "4. A density matrix is positive semidefinite ($\\rho\\geq0$, i.e. it has non-negative eigenvalues), it's hermitian ($\\rho^\\dagger=\\rho$) and has trace equal to 1 (i.e. the sum of the numbers on the diagonal is 1).\n",
    "5. $\\langle i|\\rho|i\\rangle$ is not the most general version of the Born rule (we have not generalized the measurements yet), but note that $\\langle i|\\rho|i\\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}(|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\rho)$, which will be extremely useful in the next lecture when we will generalize measurements.\n",
    "6. We can find the matrix elements with respect to a basis by computing the inner products $\\rho_{ij} = \\langle i|\\rho|j\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some explicit examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We toss a coin and when the result is heads we create a qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$, when it's tails we create a qubit in the state $|1\\rangle$. Then $P(0) = P(1) = 1/2$ and the state of this qubit is $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|/2 + |1\\rangle\\langle 1|/2$. This is known as the \"maximally mixed\" state, because it correspond to a state of maximal uncertainty. In the computational basis, this is the matrix $\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}\\frac12&0\\\\0&\\frac12\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$. The maximally mixed state actually looks like this in any basis (notice it's proportional to the identity).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We throw a die and when the result is 1 we create a qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$, when it's 2,3,4,5 or 6 we create the state $|1\\rangle$. Then $P(0) = 1/6$ and $P(1) = 5/6$ and the state of the qubit is $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|/6 + 5|1\\rangle\\langle 1|/6$. This is not a maximally mixed state. In the computational basis, this is the matrix $\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}\\frac16&0\\\\0&\\frac56\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$. This matrix will look different in other bases."

    "The off-diagonal elements indicate that there is \"_quantum coherence_\" between different basis states. For example, classical states cannot be in a superposition and in fact we can describe them with a probability distribution: the distribution on the diagonal. Quantum states on the other hand are more rich than classical states and we can see this because there are nonzero off-diagonal values. So we expect that the more classical uncertainty we include in the quantum state, the smaller the off-diagonal elements will be."
