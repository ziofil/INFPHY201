    "_Quantum Machine Learning can mean two things: either ML algorithms that run fully or in part on quantum hardware, or ML techniques applied to optimize or design quantum hardware/simulations/systems. Today we are going to look at the second: we will use Automatic Differentiation to optimize some properties of our quantum systems. AD is a very versatile meta-algorithm which we can use to turn simulations into optimizations. Although we will apply it in the context of Quantum Mechanics, it has innumerable applications._\n",

    "Today we have seen how to properly define differentiation and how to extend it to complex functions, and in particular non-holomorphic functions, which appear naturally when we simulate quantum mechanical systems and interactions.\n",
