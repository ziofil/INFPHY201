# Quantum Mechanics for Computer Scientists and Engineers

This is a course on quantum mechanics aimed at computer scientists and engineers.

When I designed these notebooks, I wanted to build upon the skills of my audience (programming,
linear algebra, etc.). Each notebook is relatively short, with a few (coding) exercises.
If you follow each lecture in order and do the exercises, at the end you will have built a
general quantum mechanics simulator.

Having developed several quantum simulators myself, I always found that building something is one
of the best way to learn.

New lectures may be added in the future.
