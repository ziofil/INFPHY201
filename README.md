# Quantum Mechanics for Computer Scientists and Engineers

This is a work-in-progress course on quantum mechanics aimed at computer scientists and engineers.
When I designed these notebooks I tried to build on the skills of my audience (programming,
linear algebra, etc.).

Each notebook is relatively short, with a few (coding) exercises.
If you follow each lecture in order and do the exercises, at the end you will have built a
general quantum mechanics simulator and optimizer.

Having developed several quantum simulators myself, I always found that building something is one
of the best ways to learn.

New lectures will be added in the future.
