# Quantum Mechanics for Computer Scientists and Engineers

This is a course on quantum mechanics aimed at computer scientists and engineers.
It builds on the strenghts of these disciplines (linear algebra, programming, etc.) and tries to go past the basics of quantum mechanics. 

The course is structured as a series of lectures, each of which is a self-contained unit.

Lectures 1,2 and 3 unpack the pillars of quantum mechanics: states, measurements and transformations.
Lectures 4,5 and 6 generalize these concepts to the case where we lack some information about the system or the measurement apparatus. This is a necessary step to make quantum mechanics useful in practice, and we don't cut corners: this is the way professional quantum physicists work.

## Lectures
### Lecture 1 - States
Lecture 1 is about (ideal) quantum states. States are the way we can describe how a quantum system "is".

### Lecture 2 - Measurements
Lecture 2 is about (ideal) quantum measurements. Measurements in quantum mechanics are not ways to reveal a pre-existing value of some property (except in some special cases), but rather ways to coerce a quantum system to pick a state from a set of possibilities.

### Lecture 3 - Transformations
Lecture 3 is about (ideal) transformations. Transformations are ways to change the state of a quantum system. Transformations and measurements have a deep connection, which is explored in this lecture.

### Lecture 4 - entanglement
In Lecture 7 we look at the concept of entanglement, which is a key concept in quantum mechanics. We don't claim to understand how it works (nobody does), but we can surely use it to carry out surprising tasks.

### Lecture 5 - mixed states
In Lecture 5 we look at realistic states, i.e. at the description of a quantum state in case we are missing some information, which is typically the case in real life.

### Lecture 6 - generalized measurements
In Lecture 6 we generalize the concept of an ideal measurement to the case where the measurement apparatus is not perfect, i.e. there is some uncertainty in what it is actually measuring.

### Lecture 7 - quantum channels
In Lecture 7 we generalize transformations to the case where we need to describe how non-ideal quantum systems transform.
