    "The idea here is to have a _parametrized_ unitary $U(\\epsilon)$, where the parameter $\\epsilon$ regulates the \"amount of transformation\", so that if $\\epsilon=0$ we have the identity matrix $U(0) = \\mathbb{1}$. Not only that, but our clever definitions make transformations into a group: $U(\\epsilon_2)U(\\epsilon_1) = U(\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2)$ (obviously they have to be transformations of the same kind for this to hold!). So let's see how we can make this happen.\n",

This is a simple way of parametrizing a unitary transformation. Don't be misguided by the similarity with the complex phase $e^{i\\epsilon}$: although the matrix exponential is related to complex phases, $\\epsilon$ should not be thought of as an angle. It is if the generator has integer eigenvalues, but it's not an angle in general, which means that in general $U(2\\pi)\\neq\\mathbb{1}$ or even that $U(\\epsilon)=\\mathbb{1}$ only for $\\epsilon = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can justify the exponential formula by looking at the spectrum: the spectrum of $M$ is made of real numbers, which implies that the spectrum of $\\exp(i\\epsilon M)$ (for real $\\epsilon$), must be on the unit circle of the complex plane, just like the spectrum of a unitary matrix.\n",

This implies that $\\exp(A)$ is not obtained by taking the exponential of each matrix element. Be careful with this, because if you write `np.exp(A)`, numpy will compute the exponential of each element, which is NOT what we want! The function we want is `scipy.linalg.expm`.\n",
