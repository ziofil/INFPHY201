    "# 4. Continuous quantum systems and wave functions\n",
    "Some properties have a clearly finite-dimensional space associated to them, such as the spin of an electron which as we saw, is only 2-dimensional. Other properties however, have an actually _continuous_ range of values, such as the position of a particle. In theoretical QM this is treated using infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (e.g. $L_2(\\mathbb{R})$, the space of mod-square integrable functions). This however is not the best for us because we cannot fit an infinite-dimensional vector space in our computer. There are a couple of ways out of this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discretize the space and things will be okay in the limit for a discretization that is small enough\n",
    " - pro: easy\n",
    " - con: states that not physically important are treated as fundamental\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Use a discrete (still finite) basis of continuous functions\n",
    " - pro: physically relevant states are fundamental\n",
    " - con: a bit harder to set up\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, we approximate an infinite-dimensional vector space with a finite-dimensional one. The clever way to think about this is that not all quantum states are equally likely/important/useful and so not all finite-dimensional approximations are equally good, even for equal dimensionality. We should pick the one that best suits our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where wave functions come in. A wave function is an element of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. You can think of it as a continuous version of a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\psi(x)|x\\rangle\\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to think about it is that in the finite dimensional case, the entries of a state vector were indexed by the little index $i$ below each amplitude $\\psi_i$, whereas here they are indexed by a continuous index $x$. After all, a function $\\psi(x)$ can be thought of as a \"vector of values\", indexed by a continuous index $x$.\n",

    "The first solution is equivalent to clipping the space from $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to a finite interval, say $[0,L]$ and dividing it into steps of length $\\delta x$. Then we obtain a Hilbert space of dimension $L/\\delta x$. This is like having a particle in a 1D box of length $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the states are going to be defined in this Hilbert space. For example, the state of a particle that sits at the origin is $|\\psi\\rangle=(1,0,0,\\dots)$, the particle that sits at position $2\\delta x$ is $|\\psi\\rangle = (0,0,1,0,\\dots)$ and so on.\n",

Also, if we have a good description of states with a fixed energy, we will see in Lecture 3 that it will become really easy to predict how a system evolves in time.\n",
