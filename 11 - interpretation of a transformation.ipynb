    "## 2. What does the transformation do?\n",
    "Okay, we have defined it. But what does $U(\\epsilon)$ actually do? Can we \"picture\" it? It turns out that there is a clever way to think about it and (perhaps unsurprisingly) it has to do with the eigenbasis of the generator (I hope you're beginning to spot a pattern here!).\n",

    "### 2.1 Interpretation of $U(\\epsilon) = \\exp(i\\epsilon M)$\n",
    "From the formula $U(\\epsilon) = V^\\dagger\\exp(D)V$ (where $i\\epsilon M = V^\\dagger D V$), we can deduce that the action of $U(\\epsilon)$ is to vary the phase of the eigenvectors of $M$! Another way of expressing $U(\\epsilon)$ is in fact:\n",

    "which means that the action of $U(\\epsilon)$ rotates the basis into the eigenbasis of $M$ (that's what $V$ does), then it rotates the phase of the eigenvectors of $M$ and finally it rotates the basis back to where it was (that's what $V^\\dagger$ does). So the action on an element $|v_i\\rangle$ of the eigenbasis of $M$ is simply to rotate its phase by an angle that depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ and on $\\epsilon$:\n",

    "\n",
    "So the simplest way of visualizing the action of a unitary transformation on a quantum state is to think of the quantum state in the basis of the generator of the transformation! Then the action of $U(\\epsilon)$ is simply to add a phase to each eigenstate! Let's see an example. Consider a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and the unitary transformation $U(\\epsilon) = \\exp(i\\epsilon M)$. Then, we simply have to express $|\\psi\\rangle$ in the eigenbasis of $M$:\n",

    "NOTE: _If any unitary quantum evolution works like this, what is the big deal with quantum computing? A quantum algorithm is a quantum circuit, which is a unitary evolution. Why does it give us so much computational power? The answer is in the size of the Hilbert space: the dimension of a state vector of $n$ qubits is $2^n$, so the size of the unitary transformation representing a quantum circuit is $2^n \\times 2^n$, which for large $n$ (e.g. already for a few tens of qubits) is too large to diagonalize on classical hardware. So it's impossible to simulate. So if we use **it** to compute stuff, it will be more powerful than classical hardware._\n",

    "### 2.2 Interpretation of the generator $M$ (and a bit about units)\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator $M$ is a Hermitian matrix. But we already have an interpretation of Hermitian matrices, they are Observables! Their eigenbasis determines a measurement basis and so on... Well, this interpretation carries over, i.e. Observables are generators of transformations and generators of transformations are Observables. So given an Observable, what transformation does it generate?\n",

    "Now let's ask the reverse question: given a transformation, can we find the meaning of its generator? Sometimes this connection is extremely clear, sometimes a bit less so. The general rule is that the quantity in the exponential must be _dimensionless_ otherwise it wouldn't make sense (what would be the meaning of its Taylor series?). So at least we can say that whatever units of measure the eigenvalues of $M$ have, they must be conjugated to the units of $\\epsilon$, i.e. their product must be dimensionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little thing that we must mention at this point (which is not _that_ important, but we must not forget it): we have been ignoring the presence of the inverse of Planck's constant $\\hbar^{-1}$ at the exponent because usually we work in \"natural units\" where $\\hbar = 1$. This is a convenient simplification, so what is left is to rememeber that the units of $\\hbar$ are [Energy$\\cdot$Time]. So for example, if $M$ is the observable of Energy and $\\epsilon$ is in units of Time, then $\\epsilon M/\\hbar$ is dimensionless, which is what we want:\n",

So in the expression $U(\\epsilon) = \\exp(i\\epsilon X)$, $\\epsilon$ must be in units of [Length$^{-1}\\cdot$Energy$\\cdot$Time] (the last two are there to cancel out the units of $\\hbar^{-1}$). Hmm, this doesn't look familiar yet (but it is, I promise). Let's express [Energy] in a more convenient way: [Energy] = [Length$\\cdot$Force] = [Length$\\cdot$Mass$\\cdot$Acceleration] = [Length$^{2}\\cdot$Mass$\\cdot$Time$^{-2}$], putting everything together we obtain that $\\epsilon$ is in units of [Mass$\\cdot$Length$\\cdot$Time$^{-1}$].
