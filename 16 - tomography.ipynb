    "Tomography is an extremely useful procedure in quantum physics, because it allows us to probe quantum systems (such as a quantum computer) and verify that things are as expected (or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 The idea\n",
    "The idea is as follows: suppose I have a machine that produces quantum systems following some fixed procedure. How can you understand what is the state of the systems? The answer is given by performing quantum tomography. There are highly optimized ways to perform tomography, for now we will be satisfied with a simpler procedure (i.e. non-adaptive).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a set of measurements that is \"tomographically complete\" (which is a fancy way of saying that the data that they produce is always enough to reconstruct any state, given enough measurements) and we will keep using those. So let's apply it to a source of qubits."

    "First of all, let's see that a projective measurement cannot be tomographically complete. For example, a measurement in the computational basis will never be able to distinguish $|+\\rangle$ from $|-\\rangle$: they both yield 0 or 1 with 50% probability and the states $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ will not look any different from each other. We need to be more clever than that. Our choice will be a 6-outcome measurement with the following six probability operators:\n",
