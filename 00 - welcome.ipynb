    "Quantum Mechanics is a theory that describes the most fundamental building blocks of everything. The typical systems that it applies to are atoms, particles, fields etc... and in principle it could apply to much larger systems. The difficulty with applying quantum mechanics to large systems is that the number of degrees of freedom involved grows linearly, but the complexity of their quantum mechanical description grows exponentially in the number of degrees of freedom. For this reason QM in practice focuses on fundamental systems, although there is no theoretical limit to the size of the systems that it applies to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the only limit is our ability to use quantum mechanics, not its correctness."
